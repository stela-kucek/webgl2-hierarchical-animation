This file contains a few remarks specific to the program for Lab3.

WebGL version: webgl2
Libraries used: glmatrix

For modularity, the program is composed of the following javascript files according to functionality:
	- lab3_main.js (main file)
	- object_loader.js (reads and parses object files)
	- object.js
		- cube.js
		- rectangle.js
		- sphere.js
		- importedObject.js (creates objects from imported, parsed values)
	- global.js
	- shader_handler.js
	- animation.js
	- holder.js (top 2 cuboid "sticks" holding the hanging sculpture)
	- threads.js (lines that simulate threads) 
	- sculpture.js (generates all objects, assigns them to levels, arranges them and 
			builds parent-child relationships)
Obj files: 
	- teapot.obj
	- teddy.obj

Supported by: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome

Not supported by: Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge

About the application:
	- Requirements are fulfilled
		* sculpture of 10 shapes (combined primitives and imported objects)
		* 4 levels of hierarchy (see attached screenshot)
		* animation of at least 2 components from different hierarchy levels
		* screenshot (also included in the submission directory as "Levels_identification_screenshot.png")
	- Updates in Lab3:
        	* illumination model used is now Phong's model only (the teapot has an added specular 
			highlight to make it appear shiny), the light source is still at (0, 10, 0)
		* no user interaction
		* synchronous call to the server in the object_loader.js file --> make sure that the data
			is completely loaded before it's accessed in the program
